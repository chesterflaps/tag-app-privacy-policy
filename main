    <h1>Privacy Policy for TAG App</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: December 2024</strong></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>TAG App ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our TAG App.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>Contact Information</h3>
    <p>When you grant permission to access your contacts, TAG App collects phone numbers from your contacts to verify TAG availability and provide the TAG service. This data is uploaded to our secure servers only to check if TAGs are available and enable TAG functionality.</p>

    <div class="important">
        <strong>Important:</strong> We do not collect or store any other personal information from your contacts, such as names, email addresses, or other contact details. We only process phone numbers for the specific purpose of providing the TAG service.
    </div>

    <h3>Apple ID Information</h3>
    <p>We use Apple's Sign in with Apple for secure authentication. We do not have access to your Apple ID information - this is handled securely by Apple. We only receive a unique identifier to verify your identity.</p>

    <h3>TAG Information</h3>
    <p>When you create TAGs, we store the TAG text and associated phone numbers to provide the TAG lookup service. This information is necessary for the core functionality of the app.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

    </ul>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement appropriate security measures to protect your information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All data is encrypted in transit and at rest</li>
        <li>We use secure cloud infrastructure (Firebase)</li>
        <li>Access to your data is strictly limited to providing the TAG service</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to third parties, except:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide the TAG service (phone numbers for verification)</li>
        <li>When required by law</li>
        <li>To protect our rights and safety</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access:</strong> Request information about what data we have about you</li>
        <li><strong>Delete:</strong> Request deletion of your account and associated data</li>
        <li><strong>Control:</strong> Manage your TAG privacy settings within the app</li>
        <li><strong>Opt-out:</strong> Deny contacts permission at any time through your device settings</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Account Deletion</h2>
    <p>You can delete your account and all associated data at any time through the Settings tab in the app. This will permanently remove all your TAGs and account information from our servers.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our app is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>
